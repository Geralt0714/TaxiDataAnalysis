# NYC Taxi Transportation Data Analysis
This is a personal analysis of NYC taxi data, based on previous [course group project](https://github.com/Geralt0714/BigDataProject). For data collection and cleaning, see the previous project<br />
In this project, I want to explore more about the information hiding in these data. Moreover, I will learn to use pyspark as well and using these data as source. To make sure the pyspark code is right,the result of pyspark should be same as the result of hadoop MapReduce.
